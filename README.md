# ACE Mart System — Python + Flask

ACE Mart is an e-commerce platform designed to simulate international snack retail operations. Built using Python, Flask, and SQLite, the codebase translates UML class diagrams into a fully interactive web application, adhering to object-oriented principles, design patterns, and clean architecture guidelines.

---

## Architecture & Project Structure

The codebase is organized into modular domain components under the `models/` directory. For demonstration and standalone testing, a unified package-free implementation containing all domain logic is maintained in `all_classes.py`.

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Module | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Factory** | `AccountFactory` | Instantiates specialized `Customer` or `Admin` instances dynamically based on type parameters, abstracting password hashing steps and ID assignments. |
| **Singleton** | `Manager` | Serves as the central access point for product collections, active orders, reporting routines, and administrative signaling. |
| **Strategy** | `PaymentGateway` | Establishes an abstract strategy for transaction processing, executed by concrete variants: `CreditCardGateway` and `EWalletGateway`. |
| **Composition** | `Customer` ◆— `ShoppingCart` | Establishes a strict composition relationship; the lifecycle of the shopping cart is directly bound to its parent `Customer` instance. |
| **Aggregation** | `Catalogue` ◇— `Category` ◇— `Product` | Leverages loose lifecycle aggregation; products can exist independently of individual categories or catalogs. |

---

## Architectural Heuristics

*   **Heuristic 2.9 (Cohesion)**: Handled directly within class boundaries. For example, `Product.reduce_stock` self-evaluates current inventory counts, executes safe modifications, and proactively registers low-stock notifications with the central `Manager` when levels fall below standard operating thresholds (10 units).
*   **Heuristic 5.1 (Role-Based Access Control / RBAC)**: Decoupled role handling is validated inside `app.py` via route decorators (`@login_required_customer`, `@login_required_admin`) and parsed in UI templates to partition views between standard Customers, operational Store Staff, and the coordinating Manager.
*   **Coupling Reduction (Riel Heuristic)**: Rather than establishing tight structural coupling across multiple reporting entities, the `Manager` singleton aggregates reporting data (such as turnover ratios and sales summaries) by traversing the active `Order` collection. This prevents direct, rigid dependencies on secondary entities like `Invoice` or `Feedback`.

## Setup & Execution

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8 or higher
*   pip (Python package installer)

### Quick Start
1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Flask Application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    *The terminal will display the local development address (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5000`). Access this URL in your browser.*
    *Upon startup, the system automatically checks for the existence of `acemart.db`. If missing, the database is created, schema initialized, and standard seed profiles are generated. On subsequent runs, state is reloaded from the database automatically.*

    * **💡 Developer Tip (System Reset):** If you want to reset the store back to its original, fresh seeded state (original stock levels, default credentials, and empty order histories) at any point during your testing, simply delete the `acemart.db` file from your project root and restart the server. The application will automatically detect the missing database, recreate the SQL schema, and re-seed the default state instantly.

3.  **Run the Standalone Domain Demo**:
    To run a terminal-only demonstration of the domain class interactions without launching the Flask server:
    ```bash
    python all_classes.py
    ```

---

## Seed Accounts

The database comes pre-seeded with three reference accounts representing distinct roles within the platform:

| Role | Email Address | Password | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Customer** | `alex@acemart.com` | `pw1234` | Cart operations, checkout, address book management, transaction simulation, orders log, support requests, and feedback reviews. |
| **Store Staff** | `lee@acemart.com` | `staff123` | Product additions, category administration, inventory adjustments, order transition processing, and support ticket resolution. |
| **Manager** | `sam@acemart.com` | `admin123` | KPI review, ticket assignments, real-time report compilation (turnover analysis, category sales breakdown, and performance reviews). |

---

## Role Operations & Platform Capabilities

### Shopper Portal (Customer)
*   **Catalog Search & Filtering**: Navigate active categories and filter specific snack items. Inactive categories and products are hidden from search lists.
*   **Cart & Address Book**: Adjust item quantities (capped at current available inventory levels), manage multiple shipping destinations, and select active delivery targets.
*   **Order & Payment Simulation**: Place orders to generate invoices. The secure payment page allows selecting card or e-wallet methods, supporting both successful payments and mock validation declines.
*   **Order Tracker & Invoices**: Monitor order progress (Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered) and access a printable paper-style invoice.
*   **Customer Care**: Submit support tickets tied to specific orders, reopen resolved cases if needed, and leave star reviews once delivery is confirmed.

### Store Staff Portal (Admin)
*   **Product Operations**: Add products, replenish inventory, and toggle catalog visibility (soft-deleting products to protect past order histories).
*   **Category Controls**: Create and rename categories, or toggle category activation states in real-time.
*   **Order Processing**: Progress order lifecycles through manual transitions (`Accept` → `Ship` → `Deliver` → `Cancel` → `Refund`). Dispatched shipments require carrier details and tracking identifiers.
*   **Resolution Center**: View open support tickets and submit resolution notes.
*   **Staff Alerts**: Bell icon notification dropdown displays updates for low-stock indicators ($\le 10$ units), new customer orders, and reviews.

### Manager Portal (Admin + Elevated Access)
*   **Consolidated Dashboard**: Displays visual analytics compiled using Chart.js, rendering five charts for product stock levels, category sales distribution, order status ratios, feedback ratings, and ticket statuses.
*   **Reporting Suite**: Request and compile reports. The system dynamically isolates database records to target specific time horizons (e.g., Last 24 Hours, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days) to compute:
    *   *Inventory Turnover Rate* (Units sold vs. average inventory level).
    *   *Top-Selling & Low-Performing Items*.
    *   *Category Sales Revenue*.
*   **Staff Coordination Loop**: Receive real-time administrative notification flags when operational staff members send requests for report updates.
